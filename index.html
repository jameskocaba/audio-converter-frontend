            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <p>1. How do I back up my SoundCloud tracks to MP3?</p>

            <p>Simply copy the shareable URL from SoundCloud, paste it into the search box on mp3aud.io, and click the "Convert to MP3" button. Our system will automatically process the link and generate a high-quality MP3 backup for you to save.</p>

            <p>2. Why should I create a backup of my SoundCloud playlist?</p>

            <p>Tracks on SoundCloud are often removed due to license changes, artist account deletions, or copyright updates. Creating a local MP3 backup ensures that you have permanent access to your favorite music and sets, even if the original link goes offline.</p>

            <p>3. What audio quality are the MP3 backups?</p>

            <p>We prioritize audio fidelity. Our tool attempts to capture the highest available bitrate provided by the shareable link. This ensures your backup sounds as close to the original stream as possible, typically 128kbps depending on the source file.</p>

            <p>4. Is it free to use mp3aud.io?</p>

            <p>Yes. Currently, our SoundCloud backup tool is 100% free to use. There is no software to install and no registration required. We provide a clean, fast interface for users to archive songs instantly.</p>
